# Welcome to Scaredsmods' documentation

This is the place you will find all documentations for every mod or plugin I have made. With this, I am aiming to provide the best documentation I possibly can for you to understand.
Even if the mod / plugin is small, it will be documented anyways.

## What you'll find here
- Mod documentation
- Plugin documentation

## Go to

- [Mods](mods/index.md)
- [Plugins](plugins/index.md)
- [Credits](credits.md)
