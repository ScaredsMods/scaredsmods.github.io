## Version schemes for the mods

Note: it isnt worth backporting to version prior to 1.18 and certainly not prior to 1.14 so those versions won't be backported.
All my mods follow this general version scheme. If it is different for some mod, it will be listed at their page.

Minecraft Version | Mod Version
------------ | ------------- 
< 1.18 | -  | 
1.18.x | 0.2.x  | 
1.19.x | 0.5.x | 
1.20.x | 1.x.x | 
1.21.x | 2.x.x | 

## Version schemes for the plugins

Plugins are mostly compatible with older versions, or future versions. Any changes required will be listed

Minecraft Version | Plugin version | 
----------------- | --------------- |
< 1.18 | legacy, not supported but probably possible
1.18 | 0.2.x
1.19 | 0.5.x
1.20 | 1.0.x
1.21 | 2.0.x
